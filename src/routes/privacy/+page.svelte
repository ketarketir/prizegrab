				Thank you for visiting <a href="/">www.prizegrab.com</a> and participating in our Sponsored Sweepstakes.

				and do not apply to any offline privacy rights or obligations, data collection and data transfers.
			</p>
			<h3>Collection of Information.</h3>

			<p>
				We collect personal data from our users during the initial registration process,
				notification process and when users contact us for any reason. Thus, users can determine to
				some extent what information they wish to provide to us. In addition to the initial
				registration process, we may, from time to time, ask users to answer surveys about our or
				third party products and services. We gather this data in order to better understand our
				users' interests and provide them with relevant offers and information.
			</p>
			<p>
				Through the use of "cookies" and "pixel tags"(both described below) and online survey and
				registration forms, we may collect personal data including name, address, email address,
				phone or mobile number. We may also collect demographic information such as age, gender,
				income level, or technical information such as IP address, domain name, email address, site
				traffic, where you visited before or after visiting our website.
			</p>
			<p>
				We use certain scripts provided by third-party service providers, such as those provided by
				Lead Intelligence, Inc. d/b/a Jornaya (“Jornaya”), ActiveProspect, Inc. (including its
				TrustedForm service) and Microsoft Clarity, to independently document users’ consent to be
				contacted, including those users’ "prior express consent" has been provided as required by
				the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (47 USC § 227), and its implementing regulations
				adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (47 CFR § 64.1200), as amended from
				time-to-time ("TCPA"). These scripts are embedded on our website and collect the following
				information when users interact with the page(s) where the scripts are present: page URL,
				mouse movements and clicks, contact information inputted by the user, a snapshot of the
				page, including IP address of the user’s computer, time on the page, date and time that the
				script was loaded, as well as the date and time of the various user interactions with the
				page, and HTTP headers from the user’s browser. For more information about the data usage,

			<h3>Collection of Technology Information.</h3>

			<p>
				"Pixel tracking" is a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on
				the Website. Pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the Website and consist of a few
				lines of computer coding. Pixels are tracking measures to determine the effectiveness of
				advertisements and compiles aggregate and specific usage statistics. A "pixel tag" is an
				invisible tag placed on certain pages of the Websites you may visit and is used to track an
				individual user's activity. We may access these pixel tags to identify activity and
				interests that may allow us to better match our offers with your interests. For example, if
				you visit our Website from an advertisement on another website, the pixel tag will allow us
				to track that this advertisement brought you to us. If you visit our website and we link you
				to another website we are able to determine that you were sent to and/or transacted business
				with a third party website. This data is collected for use in our marketing and research.
				Personally identifiable information about you is not collected by the third party
				advertising company, nor is any tracking information generated from the pixel tag allowed to
				be used by them for any other purpose other than to report website activity to us.
			</p>
			<p>
				As is true of most websites, we gather certain information automatically and store it in log
				files. This information includes internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet
				service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time stamp, and click
				data. We use this information, which does not identify you directly to analyze trends,
				administer the website, track your movements around our website and to gather demographic
				information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data
				to personally identifiable information.
			</p>
			<p>
				We may use Google Analytics on parts of our Website. If you prefer to not have your data
				used by Google Analytics you may visit the Google Analytics <a
					href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout"
					>opt-out page
				</a>and install the add-on for your browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				The third-party advertisers, vendors, and ad networks may also use cookies to show
				advertisements to you. These third-party vendors may include Google DoubleClick, Media.net,
				and/or other ad networks. Each network uses cookies to enable it to serve ads to you based
				on your visit to our Website and/or other websites on the Internet. You may opt out of a
				third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest-based advertising by visiting <a

			<h3>Sharing Information With Third Parties.</h3>

			<p>
				When you use our website, we share information that we may collect from you, such as your
				email (in hashed form), IP address or information about your browser or operating system,
				with our partner, LiveRamp Inc. and its group companies ('LiveRamp'). LiveRamp may use a
				cookie on your browser and match your shared information to its on- and offline marketing
				databases and those of its advertising partners to create a link between your browser and
				information in those other databases. We may also share hashed and de-identified email
				addresses, IP address, and advertising identifiers with LiveRamp, which uses that
				information to create a link between your device and its databases. This link may be shared
				by our partners globally to enable interest-based content or advertising throughout your
				online experience (e.g. cross-device, web, email and in app etc.) by third parties
				unaffiliated with our website. These third parties may in turn link further demographic or
				interest-based information to your browser. To opt out of LiveRamp's targeted advertising,
				please head here (https://liveramp.com/opt_out/).
			</p>
			<p>
				We share your personal information with the Sponsor of the Sweepstakes so that they may
				contact you if you win or if there is an issue with your entry. We may share aggregated
				non-personal information with third parties. We will also release specific personal
				information about you if required to do so in order to comply with any valid legal process
				such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, or court order, or to establish or exercise our
				legal rights or defend against legal claims.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the event of a merger, acquisition, or change of control of our company, your information
				would be considered a business asset and would be disclosed and transferred. We will
				disclose information we maintain when required to do so by law, for example, in response to
				a court order or a subpoena. We may also disclose personal information as required by law or
				to protect the safety and security of our users. Finally we will use your information to
				deliver our own commercial offers to you.
			</p>
			<h3>Opt-Out rights.</h3>

			<p>
				Receiving email messages from us or anyone we share your information with is optional. As
				noted earlier, the collection, use, and distribution of personal data helps us create a more
				personalized, relevant, and intelligent web service for our users. While some basic data is
				necessary to provide certain services, such as entry into the sweepstakes, there are some
				cases where the submission of information is optional. All users who provide their
				Information to PrizeGrab.com may modify and correct such Information through their personal
				profile or by contacting us <a href="/contact" class="underline">here</a>.

				procedure contained in each email at the bottom of the email. If you are receiving our
				emails and no longer wish to receive such communications, simply follow the "unsubscribe"
				instructions that appear in every one of our emails, or contact us at PrizeGrab.com, 333 S.

			<h3>No Control of Third Party Links or Privacy Practices.</h3>

			<p>
				To the extent hyperlinks or banner advertisements incorporating hyperlinks are used on our
				website which provide you access to third party websites, you should be aware that these
				third party web sites are not controlled by us and, therefore, are not subject to this
				privacy policy. We recommend that you check the privacy policies of the websites to see how
				your personal information will be used and how to opt-out.
			</p>
			<h3>Security of Information.</h3>

			<p>
				We have implemented a number of security features throughout our website and on the servers
				that hold all the collected data that are intended to prevent the unauthorized release of or
				access to the user information we collect online. The database is firewall protected and
				held in a secure location. Only authorized personnel have access to any stored personal
				information we collect from our users. However, e-mail is not encrypted and is not
				considered a secure means of transmitting any sensitive data. As such, the confidentiality
				of any communication or material transmitted over the Internet cannot be 100% guaranteed.
				Therefore we are not responsible or liable for illegal interception of personal data by
				unknown third parties.

			<h3>Personal information of Children or Persons residing outside the US</h3>

			<p>
				We do not target or direct collection of information from children under the age of
				thirteen. We do not intend to collect personal data from individuals under the age of 18 or
				non-US citizens. If we receive actual notice that a child under the age of thirteen has
				provided personal data to us or a resident from a country outside the United States, we will
				use reasonable efforts to remove such information from our database.

				to our policy, we will post a prominent notice on this page so that you are always aware of

				Please review this Privacy Policy from time to time so that you will be apprised of any
				changes.

					>
				</p>
				<p>
					To exercise the access, data portability, correction, do not sell or share, or deletion
					rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Visiting PrizeGrab.com</li>
					<li>
						By clicking <a href="/" class="underline">here</a> and filling out the form.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Only you or a person that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable
					consumer request related to your personal information. You may also make a verifiable
					consumer request on behalf of your minor child.
				</p>
				<p>
					You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice
					within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person
						about whom we collected personal information or an authorized representative.
					</li>
					<li>
						Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand,
						evaluate, and respond to it.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					We cannot respond to your request or provide you with personal information if we cannot
					verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm the personal information
					relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an
					account with us. We will only use personal information provided in a verifiable consumer
					request to verify the requestor’s identity or authority to make the request.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Response Timing and Format</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 45 days of its receipt. If
					we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason and extension
					period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to
					that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response
					by mail or electronically, at your option. Any disclosures we provide will only cover the
					12-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request’s receipt. The response we
					provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. For
					data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your personal information
					that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity
					to another entity without hindrance.
				</p>
				<p>
					We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it
					is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request
					warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost
					estimate before completing your request.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Non-Discrimination</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your state privacy rights.
					Unless permitted by the applicable privacy law, we will not:
				</p>
