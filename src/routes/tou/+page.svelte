			<h3>11. BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h3>
			<p>
				<strong
					>BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, YOU ARE GIVING UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT,
					INCLUDING YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY TRIAL.
				</strong>In arbitration, a dispute is resolved by a neutral arbitrator rather than by a
				judge or jury. Arbitration is more informal, however, an arbitrator can award the same
				relief that a court can award. The arbitration will be administered by JAMS, and conducted
				under The Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related
				Disputes ("JAMS Rules") then in effect at the time of the dispute. You may obtain copies of
				the JAMS Rules and forms and instructions for initiating arbitration by visiting the JAMS
				website at www.jamsadr.com. If for any reason JAMS is unavailable, the parties shall
				mutually select another arbitration forum. If you initiate arbitration we will promptly
				reimburse you for any standard filing fee which may have been required under JAMS'
				Procedures once you have notified us in writing and provided a copy of the arbitration
				proceedings. However, if we are the prevailing party in the arbitration, applicable law may
				allow the arbitrator to award attorneys' fees and costs to us including the filing fee.
			</p>

			<p>
				If we have a dispute, we will submit our dispute for resolution by arbitration before JAMS
				in Wyoming. For claims brought by you of Ten Thousand Dollars ($10,000.00) or less, you can
				choose whether the arbitration proceeds in person, by telephone or based only on
				submissions. The arbitrator may award any form of individual or equitable relief, including
				injunctive relief. Any award will be final and conclusive to the parties and may be entered
				in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you initiate arbitration and the arbitrator
				awards you relief we will reimburse any reasonable expenses incurred by your attorney, if
				any, including fees reasonably accrued for investigating, preparing and pursuing the claim
				in arbitration.
			</p>

			<p>
				There shall be no right or authority for any claim to be arbitrated on a class action basis
				or in a purported representative capacity. No claim submitted to arbitration is heard by a
				jury or may be brought as a private attorney general. You do not have the right to act as a
				class representative or participate as a member of a class of claimants with respect to any
				claim submitted to arbitration. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's
				claims against us and may not preside over any kind of representative or class proceeding
				against us. You acknowledge that this class action waiver is material and essential to the
				arbitration of any disputes between the parties and is non-severable from the agreement to
				arbitrate claims. If any portion of this class action waiver is limited, voided, or cannot
				be enforced, then the parties' agreement to arbitrate shall be null and void.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong
					>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION AGREEMENT, WHICH CONTAINS THIS CLASS
					ACTION WAIVER, YOU MAY ONLY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST US IN AN INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A
					PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong
				>
			</p>

			<p>
				You agree to the entry of injunctive relief to stop such a lawsuit or to remove you as a
				participant in such a suit. This agreement does not constitute a waiver of any of your
				rights and remedies to pursue a claim individually and not as a class action in binding
				arbitration as provided above. This provision preventing you from bringing, joining or
				participating in class action lawsuits is an independent agreement. You may opt-out of these
				Dispute Resolution Provisions by providing written notice of your decision within thirty
				(30) days of the date that you first visit the Website.
			</p>

				Websites owned or operated by parties other than us. These links are provided for your

				have the right at any time or from time to time to modify or amend the terms and conditions
				of this Agreement and display such changes which shall act as an amendment to these Terms of
				Use without further notification to you. Use of the Website by you after such posting shall
				constitute acceptance of the modified or amended terms. No modification made by you shall be
				binding upon us unless it is made in writing and signed by us. Delaware law governs the
				performance and interpretation of these Terms of Use, without regard to any conflicts of law
				provisions. If any provision of these Terms of Use is found invalid or unenforceable, that
				provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent possible, and the other provisions
				contained herein will remain in full force and effect. No failure of either party to
				exercise or enforce any of its rights under these Terms of Use will act as a waiver of such
				rights. If the performance of any part of these Terms of Use is prevented, hindered, delayed
				or otherwise made impracticable by reason of any flood, riot, fire, judicial or governmental
				action, labor disputes, act of God or any other cause or causes beyond our control, we shall
				be excused to the extent that we are prevented, hindered or delayed by such cause or causes.
				If you violate these Terms of Use, or otherwise create legal exposure or risk for us, we
				will stop providing all or part of Service to you. You may be notified by email or at the
				next time you attempt to access your account, or your access may be stopped without notice.
				By deleting your account and access all services will be terminated including termination
